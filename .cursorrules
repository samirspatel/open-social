# GitSocial Development Plan & Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
GitSocial is a distributed social media application where users' data lives in their own GitHub repositories, implementing true data ownership and portability. Each user controls their social graph through structured JSON files in their personal GitHub repo.

## Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (cache only), Redis (sessions/realtime)
- **External**: GitHub API, GitHub OAuth, GitHub Webhooks
- **Real-time**: Socket.io
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)

```

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, comprehensive type coverage
- **Testing**: Unit tests (Jest), E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization, lazy loading
- **Security**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**: All user data lives in GitHub repos
2. **Local Caching Only**: PostgreSQL stores aggregated/cached data, not source data
3. **Cryptographic Signatures**: All posts signed for authenticity
4. **Real-time via Webhooks**: GitHub webhooks + Socket.io for live updates
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

### Environment Variables Required

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: All utility functions and API routes
- **Integration Tests**: GitHub API interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (signup, post, follow)
- **Performance Tests**: Feed generation and API response times
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, data validation

### Deployment Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vercel (Next.js optimized)
- **Backend API**: Railway/Render (containerized Node.js)
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL + Redis
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, custom metrics for performance

## Success Metrics
- **Technical**: <100ms API response time, 99.9% uptime
- **User Experience**: <3 second page loads, mobile responsive
- **Adoption**: User retention, daily active users, posts per user
- **Network**: Cross-app data portability, third-party integrations

This development plan provides a structured approach to building GitSocial while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on user feedback and technical discoveries during implementation.
